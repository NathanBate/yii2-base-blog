# Personal Project: Base Blog

This was a personal project that I did for a friend and it has a narrow
application. As with an personal project, it never gets enough love as it should.

# base-blog

A Yii base install customized for my personal use.  This includes 
API and PHP web app controllers.  This repository is not meant to be 
used directly.  All new projects that use this should do so 
through the [blog starter project](https://github.com/NathanBate/yii2-blog-starter).
